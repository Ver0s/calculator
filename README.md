# Calculator for the odin project
It's a very basic calculator I made for the course. Although it has only basic functionalities it wasn't easy at all. It took a while but I still consider it uncompleted and will probably come back to it and refactor at some point. Core logic wasn't really that hard to implement here. What got me good is error handling. I felt like if one bug was fixed 5 more appeared. I'm perfectly aware that the code under the hood could use a lot of improvements but at the same time it taught me a lot.


## Key takeaways
- Global variables can be extremely hard to manage especially if the project grows rapidly. Sometimes I felt like it was impossible to know what they contain and what type they have after i had clicked a button.
- Structuring most if not all of the logic before writing a single line of code can save a lot of debugging. Unfortunately I didn't do much planning beforehand and it really shows in the code. Honestly I should've learnt it faster and just scraped the whole code instead of patching the bugs with silvertape every time.
